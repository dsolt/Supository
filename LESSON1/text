Ok, let's get started.  Goals:

Learn to compile and run a simple program written for you.  
Understand the parts of the program.  
Be able to make a simple modification.

The program is called add_numbers.c

Look at the file.  It is commented with human readable documentation in the
file.  After you look at it, try compiling:

$  gcc add_number.c -o add_numbers
     
add_numbers.c is the name of your source code 
add_numbers is the name of your resulting program.   

You notice you can't run add_number.c:

$ ./add_number.c
./add_number.c: permission denied

But you can run add_numbers because the compiler has marked the file as 
"ok to execute":

$ ./add_number 1 2 3
Program (./add_number) found the sum of the command line to be 6

Now can you guess how to modify the program to multiple the numbers together
instead of adding them?
